Welcome to LucidSense Documentation.

You can get started quickly by following [our tutorial](https://medium.com) to build a conversational user experience using a simple AI agent.

With LucidSense you can build AI agents with which your users can talk to interact with your applications. This is possible by leveraging Large Language Models to understand the user speech and inferring if any function calls to your applications are needed in order to fulfil the user query in the chat. Functions can be defined by using API call specifications and potentially other mechanisms in the future. LucidSense agents will call these functions whenever needed and enable the users to have a conversational user experience with your applications.

You can refer to the rest of the sections in the documentation for a more detailed guide.
