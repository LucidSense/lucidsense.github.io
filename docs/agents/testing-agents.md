# Testing an Agent

- To test an agent, navigate to the agents page from the top navigation bar and click on the "Chat" button against the agent.

- Set the context variables that needs to be set for the conversation in JSON format. This is needed for agents whose functions have parameters needed for execution but are hidden from the LLM. These variables would typically be passed in the context during API execution of an agent while using the Agent Chat API.
